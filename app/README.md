## Parea Mobile App

### Info 

React Native + Expo + Firebase

### Setup 

0.5. Make sure NPM is installed, if not: [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
1. Clone this repo
2. `cd PareaReact`
3. `npm install`


Its that easy folks. Many dependencies are required, like XCode for Ios simulator and AndriodStudio for Android development, but the node/`npm` prompts should get you there. 

### TODO: 

1. Clear nasty dependency warnings across the board (I guess using a template from 2 years ago has its drawbacks)
2. Decide which views are going to be the most useful and delete everything else
3. Begin adding two primary MVP views --> Map + Community Hub
